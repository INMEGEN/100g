SV (structural variation) is the large structural variation in genome. We use breakdancer software to detect SV.

SV folder contains these two files:

1.*.breakdancer.flt.gff			the result of SV£¬GFF£¨General Feature Format£©format
2.*.breakdancer.flt.hg19_multianno.xls	 the annotation result of SV(xls format)£¬excel or EditPlus can be used for opening the file when the file is larger.

	(4) Ref£ºbase at this position in reference genome, here is empty.
	(5) Alt£ºbase at this position in sequencing data, here is empty.
	(6) GeneName£ºthe names of genes related to this variation
	(7) Func£ºtells whether the variant hit exons or hit intergenic regions, or hit introns, or hit a non-coding RNA genes.

	(19) genomicSuperDups£ºrepetitive segments in genome. For a region to be included in the track, at least 1 Kb of the total sequence (containing at least 500 bp of non-RepeatMasked sequence) had to align and a sequence identity of at least 90% was required.
	(20) dgvMerged£ºannotation from Database of Genomic Variants.
	(21) gwasCatalog£ºtells whether this variation has been identified by published Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), collected in the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). It lists the diseases related to this variation. ¡°.¡± means this vatiation has not been reported by published GWAS study.
	(22) Repeat£ºannotation of repeats from RepeatMasker program.
	(23) encodeGm12878£ºpredicted functional elements in the genome of cell line Gm12878. ChromHMM was used to get twenty-five states by integrating ENCODE ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and FAIRE-seq data; these states were used to segment the genome, and they were then grouped and colored to highlight predicted functional elements. (The relationship between state and functional element is as follow: Tss, TssF¡ª¡ªActive Promoter; PromF¡ª¡ªPromoter Flanking; PromP¡ª¡ªInactive Promoter; Enh, EnhF¡ª¡ªCandidate Strong enhancer; EnhWF, EnhW, DNaseU, DNaseD, FaireW¡ª¡ªCandidate Weak enhancer/DNase; CtrcfO, Ctcf¡ª¡ªDistal CTCF/Candidate Insulator; Gen5', Elon, ElonW, Gen3', Pol2, H4K20¡ª¡ªTranscription associated; Low¡ª¡ªLow activity proximal to active states; ReprD, Repr, ReprW¡ª¡ªPolycob repressed; Quies, Art¡ª¡ªHeterochromatin/Repetitive/Copy Number Variation)
