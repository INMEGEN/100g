We use SAMtools to detect SNP based on BAM file, and the final variation result is obtained by using ANNOVAR to annotate these SNP sites.

SNP folder contains two files:
1.*.snp.reformated.vcf.gz		the annotation result of SNP£¬vcf£¨Variant Call Format£©format
2.*.snp.annovar.hg19_multianno.xls.gz	the annotation result of SNP (compressed format).Unzip the files, excel or EditPlus can be used for opening the file when the file is larger
==========================================================================================================================

The explanations of these files are as follows:
1.VCF (Variant Call Format) file Format is stored variation results.
Begin with # as detailed interpretation of documents.
2¡¢*.snp.annovar.hg19_multianno.xls.gz file is *.snp.reformated.vcf.gz file in xls format, and adds functional annotation from OMIM,GO, KEGG¡¢PID¡¢BIOCARTA¡¢REACTOME database.

Each column annotation information is as follows:
	 CHROM£ºchromosome
         POS: the position of variation on chromosome.
         ID: the ID of the variation in dbSNP.
         REF: base at this position in reference genome.
         ALT: base at this position in sequencing data.
         QAUL: variation quality value.
         FILTER: the TAG of filteration, if the site satisfies all the filteration conditions, mark PASS.
         GeneName: the names of genes related to this variation
         Func: tells whether the variant hit exons or hit intergenic regions, or hit introns, or hit a non-coding RNA genes. (exonic, splicing, UTR5, UTR3, intronic, ncRNA_exonic, ncRNA_intronic, ncRNA_UTR3, ncRNA_UTR5, ncRNA _splicing, upstream, downstream, intergenic).
         Gene: the IDs of transcript whose function has changed like the value in column ¡®Func¡¯.
         GeneDetail: description of variations in UTR, splicing, ncRNA, splicing or intergenic.

         AAChange: when ¡®Func¡¯ equals ¡®exonic¡¯or ¡®exonic;splicing¡¯, this value gives the change of amino acid in each related transcript.

(The relationship between state and functional element is as follow: Tss, TssF¡ª¡ªActive Promoter; PromF¡ª¡ªPromoter Flanking; PromP¡ª¡ªInactive Promoter; Enh, EnhF¡ª¡ªCandidate Strong enhancer; EnhWF, EnhW, DNaseU, DNaseD, FaireW¡ª¡ªCandidate Weak enhancer/DNase; CtrcfO, Ctcf¡ª¡ªDistal CTCF/Candidate Insulator; Gen5', Elon, ElonW, Gen3', Pol2, H4K20¡ª¡ªTranscription associated; Low¡ª¡ªLow activity proximal to active states; ReprD, Repr, ReprW¡ª¡ªPolycob repressed; Quies, Art¡ª¡ªHeterochromatin/Repetitive/Copy Number Variation)
