Raw data obtained from sequencing contains adapter contamination, low-quality reads. These sequence artifacts can increase the complexity on downstream processing analysis, , which means quality control is necessary(listed below). All the downstream analysis will base on clean reads.
The steps of data processing are as follows:
        (1) Discard the paired reads when either one read contains adapter contamination.
        (2) Discard the paired reads when either one read contains uncertain nucleotides more than 10 percent.
        (3) Discard the paired reads when single read has more than 50 percentage low quality

This folder contains the clean data of each sample£º
1.*.clean.fq.gz         The compressed FASTQ file by quality controlling

2.MD5.txt	        The MD5 value of .clean.fq.gz file, used to check the file integrity
In file name,1,2 stands for paired-end sequences files, respectively

The explanations of fq.gz file are as follows:

1.The original raw data obtained from high throughput sequencing platforms(e.g. illumina HiSeqTMXTen/2000/MiSeq) is transformed to sequenced reads by base calling. Raw data is recorded in FASTQ file, which contains sequence information (reads) and corresponding sequencing quality information. Every read in FASTQ format is stored in four lines as follows:
@HWI-ST1276:71:C1162ACXX:1:1101:1208:2458 2:N:0:CGATGT

Line 1 begins with a '@' character and is followed by a sequence identifier and an optional description (like a FASTA title line).
Line 2 is the raw sequence reads. 
Line 3 begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.
Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, and must contain the same number of characters as bases in the sequence.

Illumina sequence identifier details:

	HWI-ST1276	Unique instrument name 
	71		Run ID
	C1162ACXX	Flowcell ID
	1		Flowcell lane
	1101		Tile number within the flowcell lane
	1208		'x'-coordinate of the cluster within the tile
	2458		'y'-coordinate of the cluster within the tile
	2		Member of a pair, 1 or 2 (paired-end or mate-pair reads only)
	N		Y if the read fails filter (read is bad), N otherwise
	0		0 when none of the control bits are on, otherwise it is an even number
	CGATGT		Index sequence
